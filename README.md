# ***THIS MOD IS NOW DEPRECATED AS-OF OFFICIAL PATCH 5.0.0***

# Empire Politics Return Region Dilemma Fix
A mod for Total War Warhammer III. This mod implements a full and proper fix for the missing Elector regions that were previously causing the Empire Politics system to break. I was hoping that CA would fix this in patch 2.3.0, but instead they simply added a hacky script workaround to bypass dilemmas for regions that caused the break. This mod removes that workaround and adds in the missing dilemmas for all the previously broken regions.

**Warning**: In order to remove CA's workaround, I have had to resort to completely replacing the Empire politics script. This is not ideal. Other mods that alter the same script positioned above this mod in the load order will possibly prevent dilemmas occurring.

**N.B.** If you use Mixu's Unlocker then you **_MUST_** use the [added sub-mod](https://github.com/DrDCB/TWWH3_Empire_Politics_Return_Region_Dilemma_Fix_Mixer_Sub-Mod) that fixes an incompatibility with Mixer's version of the script. Mixu added in CA's workaround to prevent Mixer reverting to the old script break behaviour, but that prevents this mod from functioning. Follow the listed instructions regarding load order.

This mod was originally created as a submission to the Community Bug Fix Mod for patch 2.2.1. However, with CA's workaround in patch 2.3.0 necessitating a full script override, it has been deemed too excessive for CBFM. There was a suggestion that it might be passed along to Mixu for inclusion in Mixer, but I'm not sure how that will pan out. It might also be possible that CA change something in a hotfix. Either way, this may make the mod redundant at some point.
